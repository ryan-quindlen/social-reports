# Social Reports

Polished campaign recap pages for Zapier Social, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to Use

In Cursor, trigger the skill with:
- "build a social report page"
- "social recap for [campaign name]"
- "campaign recap page"

The skill walks you through everything step by step. You'll need:
1. A campaign name and date range
2. Which exec(s) to focus on
3. Screenshots (the skill tells you exactly what to capture)

Everything else gets pulled from Ordinal automatically.

## Structure

- `_template/` - Base HTML template (don't edit directly; copy for each campaign)
- Each campaign gets its own folder: `campaign-name-report-YYYY-MM-DD/`

## Live Pages

Reports are hosted at: `https://ryan-quindlen.github.io/social-reports/[folder-name]/`
